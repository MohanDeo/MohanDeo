- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MohanDeo. I'm working as a Junior Software Engineer/Quantitative Analyst [@Qi](https://www.quant-insight.com/). Before that, I studied Applied Mathematics (Computational Biology) at the University of Cambridge, and worked as a a SWE at [@cyted](https://cyted.ai/). I also hold a BSc in Physics from the University of Manchester.
- At Quant insight, my work involves developing platform for pre- and post-trade insights for instituational clients, as well as developing macro-aware ETFs.
- In my MPhil I spent time creating models, like HMM's to identify protein coding regions of a genome, or using biostatistics to analyse RNA-Seq or CHIP assays. At Cyted, I worked in the BE developing web applications for our distributed system. At Manchester, I created simulations to model physical processes, and analysed data from lab experiments to draw conclusions.
