- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MohanDeo. I recently completed my MPhil in Computational Biology at the University of Cambridge. Previously, I was a SWE at [@cyted](https://cyted.ai/), an AI company developing diagnostic tools for oesophageal cancer. I also hold a BSc in Physics from the University of Manchester.

- In my MPhil I spent time creating models, like HMM's to identify protein coding regions of a genome, or using biostatistics to analyse RNA-Seq or CHIP assays. At Cyted, I worked in the BE developing web applications for our distributed system. At Manchester, I created simulations to model physical processes, and analysed data from lab experiments to draw conclusions.
