- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MohanDeo. I recently completeed my MPhil in Computational Biology at the University of Cambridge. Previously, I was a SWE at [@cyted](https://cyted.ai/), an AI company developing diagnostic tools for oesophageal cancer. I am also a Physics graduate from University of Manchester.

- In my course I spend time creating models, like HMM's to identify protein coding regions of a genome, or using biostatistics to analyse RNA-Seq or CHIP assays. At Cyted, I spent time developing apps to collect and process biological data, and at Manchester I created simulations to model physical processes, and analysed data from lab experiments to draw conclusions.
